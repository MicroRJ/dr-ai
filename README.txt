A small 2 layer AI that can learn to recognize digits with over %90 accuracy.
It analyses over 60,000 28 by 28 image samples in less than half a second, whether
that is good or bad is not my concern, the primary goal of this
project is to learn. Please do let me know if I've made any mistakes,
which I most likely have made!
This is a very simple program and it does not use any semi-advanced techniques whatsoever.
