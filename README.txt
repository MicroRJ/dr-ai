A small 2 layer AI that can learn to recognize digits with over %90 accuracy with literally just one pass over %80
percent of the samples, that's all it does.
That being said, it can analyze over 60,000 28 by 28 image samples in less than half a second, whether
that is good or bad is not my concern as the primary goal of this project is to learn.
Please do let me know if I've made any mistakes, which I most likely have made!
Once again, this is a very simple program and it does not even use any semi-advanced techniques whatsoever.
To use this program you must first download the samples from: http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist
